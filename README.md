#  Coral Bleaching vs Sea Surface Temperature (2019–2020)
**Author:** **Nguyễn Triệu Vy Thư**
**Scope:** Analyze the correlation between coral bleaching percentage and sea surface temperature at shallow reefs (0–5m) in Indonesia and Philippines.

## Project Objectives
- Clean and preprocess survey data (2019–2020)
- Focus on reefs at vulnerable depth (0–5m)
- Visualize bleaching trends, geographical distribution, and temperature correlation
- Export monthly average bleaching for dashboard use

##  Sample Visualizations
Include key charts here (or link to `charts/` folder)

## Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git + GitHub

## Data Source
Provided by global coral survey initiatives (Donner et al.)
